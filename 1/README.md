## Explanation

### Tranfer

In this secion I decided to only use an "account number" to validate where is the money going to be sent, taking inspiration in the CuentaRut from Banco Estado in Chile. But I'm aware that in most of the situations to do these kind of transactions the app are going to ask for name, ID, account number, account type and so on.
